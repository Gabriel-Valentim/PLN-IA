main selection criteria animals reared intensive 
systems. Although productive performance sows improved 
considerably recent years due advances genetic 
improvement, wide variation performance still common 
(Baxter et al., 2020). Several factors 
associated low productivity sow culling. High 
weight loss lactation, feed restriction, high 
temperatures, long lactations, weaning-to-service intervals, diseases, 
injuries, reproductive failure, irregular return estrus 
factors reduce productivity lead early culling 
sows (Koketsu et al., 2017). Therefore, 
capacity predict sows high reproductive performance

possible predict production piglets considering first-
